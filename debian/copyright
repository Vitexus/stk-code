License: Creative Commons by-sa 3.0
---
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
      pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
      arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
      or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or
      any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
      including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
      a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
      for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
      Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
      the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
      considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
      encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
      or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
      below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their
      contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
      included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
      themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
      defined above) for the purposes of this License.
   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
      copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
      transfer of ownership.
   d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
      offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
      individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
      individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition
      (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers,
      and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
      otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
      (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
      entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
      (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
      broadcast.
   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
      this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
      scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
      expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
      writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
      in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
      cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
      process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
      architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to
      which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
      photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
      three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or
      science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data
      to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work
      performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
      otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
      who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
      the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
      exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
      communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
      process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
      performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
      members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
      individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
      means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
      of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
      rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
      without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
      fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
      protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
      medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
      including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
      clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
      the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
      original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
      could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
      Collections; and,
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   e. For the avoidance of doubt:
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
            the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
            You of the rights granted under this License;
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
            exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
            of the rights granted under this License; and,
       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
            royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor
            is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
            licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of
            the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
      this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
      the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
      recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
      under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
      keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
      of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not
      impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
      ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
      granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4
      (a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
      not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
      to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
      from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You
      create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
      Section 4(b), as requested.
   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
      Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
      4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
      reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
      Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
      Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
      or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
      title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
      with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
      licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3
      (b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
      Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
      Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The
      credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
      reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
      Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
      contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
      part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
      credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt,
      You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
      attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
      under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
      any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
      Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
      of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of
      the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
      otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
      Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
      or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
      derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
      the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
      jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
      deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
      action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
      Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
      fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
      reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right
      to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
      Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
      You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
      provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
      those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
      termination of this License.
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
      Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
      any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
      withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
      to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
      continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
      the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
      terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
      offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
      and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
      parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
      consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
      by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
      respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
      here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
      appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
      without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
      License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
      for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
      September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
      Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
      the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
      rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
      which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
      corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
      in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
      under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
      under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in
      the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
      rights under applicable law.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
